## Summary

This is my quest, no matter how hopeless, no matter how far; to reach a world of adaptivity, where ubiquitous computing is as natural as breathing.

The embarkation, and the journey is through enabling companies to embrace a culture of innovation, uphold the highest technological craftsmanship, and transition to cloud nativity with fog computing.

International corporations such as Vodafone Hutchinson, CIMB, NTT Data, and Virgin Australia are counted among satisfied clients.



I have the pleasure of working with a plethora of industries such as 7 sta history of delivery with happen to be one of the top 10 in the Containerization space and have two Artificial Technologies behind me.


Everything we do, we believe in challenging the status quo. We
believe in thinking differently.

The way we challenge the status quo is by making our products
beautifully designed, simple to use and user-friendly.

And we happen to make great computers.


One of the top 10 in the World operating in the Containerization space (Docker, Kubernetes, Nomad, OCI)

Operating on the razor sharp edge of technology 24x7 mastering application, selection, software development, automation, and DevOps via the full technology stack from Web Applications to Linux Kernels.

Built two evolved Artificial Intelligence technologies in the early 2000's (still without equal); intimately involved with 7 technology startups; maintaining the immutable enterprise distribution of Kubernetes Cyvive.io; and pioneered OSIMM Layer 4-7 governance by policy for containerized microservices via Fathomable.io

I have the priviledge of assisting some of the most prestegious enterprises in Asia Pacific such as:

→ Australia: FlightCenter, Tatts Group, Cook Medical (AUS), IAG, INGDirect, NAB, Vodafone Hutchinson, Coles, Telstra, NATAA
→ Asia Pacific: CIMB (Malaysia), NTT Docomo (Japan), NTT Data (Sapporo Japan), IBM (Japan), Acrodea (Japan)

Companies engage my services to Speed up, Scale up and considerably increase their Margin, in the following areas:
→ Kubernetes security stability and implementation (any cloud provider or on-premises)
→ Best Practices of Using Containers
→ Transformation from Monolithic or complex containers towards Microservices & Serverless
→ Immutable Infrastructure
→ Cloud Native Architecture & Best Practices Design
→ Multi-Datacenter Deployments
→ Any complex or high risk technological challenges
→ Cost Optimization of Infrastructure
→ Hot / Warm Deployments of the Entire Company

I'm not afraid of taking risks and challenging the “Status Quo”. I look into the future, and with the utmost of integrity I strive for excellence by applying myself to forward thinking, strategic planning and highly skilled implemmentation and achievement, both personally & technologically.
